    "To achieve multiclass classification, I decided to use a different featuring method. I picked the TF-IDF model as opposed to the bag-of-word model. The bag-of-word model is straightforward yet it is too simple: first, if the comments contain new words, our dictionary would have to increase in size to account for the new words. This will increase the size of the feature matrix and consumes a lot of resources. Second, the feature matrix is very likely to have a lot of zeros, which is exactly the kind of sparse matrix we want to avoid. TF-IDF performs better in the two cases mentioned above. It also contains information on the more important words and the less important ones as well. So all data points are presented in a more meaningful way. <br />\n",
    "I picked one-vs-rest as the multiclass method. In this case, we are trying to to classify comments' emotions. Therefore, it is more relevant to use a one-vs-rest method because the number of labels we have is really small(3). This means that we won't have to worry about generating an absurd number of classifiers from the primary dataset.<br />\n",
    "I picked [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000] as the range for hyperparameters and use the 5-fold CV to find the best hyperparameters. The best hyperparameter for the a model with linear kernel is C=0.1 with a accuracy score of 0.7553118574366005, and for a model with quadratic kernel it is C=1, r=1000 with an accuracy score of 0.7272104180945853. The gap here isn't significant. However, considering the fact that quadratic kernel takes a lot more time to tune, linear kernel seems to be the optimal one in this scenario. <br />\n",
    "The techniques I used beyond the current course material are primarily from the nltk package. Besides using the TF-IDF model, I also used lemmatization to better preprocess the words in the comment. Lemmatization allows us to categorize a word into nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. It also transforms them into their original forms. I also used stop words and position tagging in the process of lemmatization."
